# ReproducibleRAssignment

This Github repository contains my data pipeline for Question 2 of the Reproducible R assignment which my partner will download and try to run. I have also included the folders "data" - to store my data, "figures" - to store my figures and "functions" to store my functions but these are not necessary to download to successfully run my data pipeline.  

# My data pipeline - [datapipeline](https://github.com/mountainsandwhales/ReproducibleRAssignment/blob/main/Question2.Rmd)  
# Subfolders - [data](https://github.com/mountainsandwhales/ReproducibleRAssignment/tree/main/data) and [figures](https://github.com/mountainsandwhales/ReproducibleRAssignment/tree/main/figures) and [functions](https://github.com/mountainsandwhales/ReproducibleRAssignment/tree/main/functions)
